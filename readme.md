- [Type Scale](https://typescale.com/) - For font styles

### What we learned

- Although Firefox has been incredibly helpful for our debugging needs and implementing effective type scales has greatly improved our website's typography, I've found it challenging to strike a balance between creating a visually engaging website and ensuring its semantic structure. While the use of semantic HTML tags such as h1, h2 and p can help to establish structure and meaning for our content, I recognize the importance of using CSS to enhance its overall aesthetic appeal. 
- The use of grid and flexbox has helped us to efficiently slice our website and create a layout that's both aesthetically pleasing.

### Continued development

- We'd like to improve our layout and design.
- Improvement of the website's responsiveness.
- We'd like to add more features.
